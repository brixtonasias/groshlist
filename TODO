A list of stuff that comes up while working on the project

- Make complete use of generic views for most of the app
	- Register function

- Redesign / Design the page
	- logo
	- layout

- CSS tweaking
	- table layout
	
	
Maybe later:

- urls.py
	- move guide-urls to guide folder?
	- When would that make sense?
